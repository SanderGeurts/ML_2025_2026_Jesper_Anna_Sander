### Intro

In the teacher notes in brightspace you find the grading scheme of the final project report and presentation with the relative weight + the midterm weight on the construction of your final grade. If not yet done, please read the notes.

Below some more clarifications/directions:


## Project report

You can see an example of a successful project report at example.pdf. This is a very good report! highlighting an excellent project.

Requirements:
- Do not exceeed 6 pages (excluding bibliography)
- Highlight the contribution: who is the main author of which section? If all contributed equally to all the sections, just write the authors in alphabetical order below the project title
- Scientifically sound structure: what is the problem, how you taggle it, results, conclusions, bibliography 
- You will get many plots out of the project but you will have only space for few of them within the page limit. Decide which one are the most relevant for your message, make sure the figure caption is short but at the same time exhaustive (i.e if I read only the caption can I get an idea, in the context of the project, of what am I looking at?)
- Please note that those are scientific projects, therefore, while a perfect conclusion of the project means an excellent grade, even a negative result could lead to an excellent grade if the prodecudre is well documented and the conclusions are valuable to learn something new. 

Note: you will be graded on the project report so a group having 1) really good and sound results and 2) really well written report can expect a very good grade. However, we will follow you closely during tutorials and grade differences between group members might arise depending on the conduct during the project development process. We aim to reward excellence and hard work

Deadline: each group should send to A. Grelli the reports on 10AM of the day before the final project presentation.


## Project presentation

The final exam will be a mini-simposium where each group presents its findings. For classroom and date (see MyTimetable). 
Requirements:
- Each group has 12 min presentation + 3 min question time
- the strcture of the presentation should a clear: context/problem, solution strategy, results, conclusions+outlook
- The chair of the day (A. Grelli), will threat the simposium as a workshop or conference. The timeslots will be enforced. What does it means? Be sure you stay within the 12 min allocated (this is an element for grading). Note: I consider this point important since it prepares you for the real research life: a researcher that goes overtime at a conference is simply cut by the chair of the session. The main point is how to convey the real message leaving involved details for discussions at a later stage.
- Who should present? up to the group the decision, it can be all of you or just one of you. Of course everyone contribute to the slides and all the names are in the first slide   

Deadline: please send the presentations to yout TAs at latest 30 min before the symposium starts


## Remarks

Note: those projects with 3-4 persons per group will bring a complication, beside technical implementation of ML algorithms, that you will face in your life as a researcher or academic ater the master. Meaning that not everyone in the group might give the same contribution as well as group members can have very different opinions on the same point of discussion. Furthermore, while writing the report it might be difficult to decide who is the main author of what. Please be aware that I consider these possible issues an integral part of the learning process (actually a very crucial one for your future) and you are always welcome in case you want to have a chat on what should be done (i.e how to beahve in case of tensions and what a real research group would do)
